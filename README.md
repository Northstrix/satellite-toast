## Features

- **Accent, Background & Text Color Customization**  
  Every visual aspect can be customized, including accent colors, background, text, icon, timer bar, borders, and hover states.

- **Animated Background Bars**  
  Optionally display animated accent-colored bars as a dynamic visual effect behind the notification.

- **Satellite Orbit Animation**  
  Show or hide an animated satellite orbit layer, and choose whether it appears in front of or behind the main toast content.

- **Progress Timer Bar (Two Animations)**  
  Built-in timer/progress bar with either 'shrink' (collapses from both sides) or 'deplete' (linear reduction from one end) animation modes. Both can be paused on hover.

- **Typography & Border Control**  
  Fine-tune font sizes and weights for title/content, and adjust border radii, border colors, and widths for all visual elements.

- **Custom Icon Support**  
  Replace the default icon with a custom SVG per notification for unique branding or specific context.

- **Auto-Dismiss & Pause on Hover**  
  Configure how long each toast persists on screen (longevity). Notification dismissal automatically pauses when hovered with the mouse, then resumes on mouse leave.

- **Animated Entry/Exit**  
  Notifications animate in and out with slide and bounce transitions, adapting direction to RTL or LTR layouts.

- **Customizable Close Button**  
  Each toast features a close button with fully customizable colors, border, and hover behavior for accessibility and UX.
